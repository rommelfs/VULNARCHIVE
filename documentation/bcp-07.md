# Introduction

Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEVs) have become a critical signal for vulnerability prioritization, operational risk management, and policy-driven remediation. Governments, CSIRTs, and sectoral authorities increasingly rely on KEV lists to mandate patching, trigger incident response, or inform compliance decisions. However, existing KEV publications are largely list-based and opaque, often asserting exploitation without clearly expressing who made the claim, when exploitation was observed versus declared, what type of evidence supports it, where it was seen, or with what level of confidence. As KEV data is increasingly consumed by automated systems and cross-border information-sharing mechanisms, the absence of structured, contextual metadata limits interoperability, trust calibration, and analytical reuse.

This Best Current Practice defines a standardized KEV assertion format that preserves the intentionally simple and binary nature of KEV while adding minimal but essential context. Within the GCVE or other ecosystem, where vulnerabilities may be disclosed and referenced by multiple independent authorities, exploitation claims must be clearly distinguishable from vulnerability identifiers and treated as attributable statements rather than universal truths. The format enables multiple, potentially conflicting assertions to coexist, supports explicit attribution and confidence signaling, and facilitates interoperability with existing vulnerability, CSIRT, and policy ecosystems without turning KEV into full threat intelligence or requiring disclosure of sensitive evidence.

# Known Exploited Vulnerability - KEV Assertion Format

This format describes a **generic KEV (Known Exploited Vulnerability) assertion format**.

The goal is to express *who claims exploitation*, *when*, *based on what*, *where it was observed*, and *with which level of confidence*, without turning KEV into full threat intelligence. A KEV assertion is usually very binary and lacking some meta-information. The format adds some information which could better capture details about the exploitation. A majority of the fields are optional except `vulnerability`, `status` and `evidence.[].source` which are recommended.

## Usage Consideration

KEV and CVE (or GCVE) represent different layers in the model, and that distinction is intentional.

A vulnerability identifier (CVE/GCVE) is primarily about establishing the identity of a vulnerability something that the ecosystem can refer to consistently over time. KEV, on the other hand, is an assertion about observed exploitation activity, made by an observer at a given point in time. In an ideal world, the same actor that defines the vulnerability (for example, a vendor CNA) would also confirm exploitation, but in practice these concerns are frequently dissociated.

There are several common situations where vulnerability identity and exploitation assertions do not originate from the same place or even at the same time:

- Embargoed or restricted vulnerabilities, where exploitation is observed and tracked within a limited circle (CSIRTs, intelligence teams, trusted communities) before public disclosure or before a vendor-assigned identifier exists.
- Situations of disagreement or asymmetry of knowledge, where an observer has high-confidence evidence of exploitation while the vendor disputes impact, scope, or even the existence of the vulnerability.
- Early or partial observations, where exploitation activity is detected before a stable understanding of affected products, attack vectors, or vulnerability class has been established.

The KEV format explicitly models exploitation as an event-level assertion linked to a vulnerability identity, rather than as part of the identity itself. This reflects operational reality: exploitation is something that happens, may occur multiple times, may be observed by different parties, and may be interpreted differently as more information becomes available.

This separation already exists implicitly across today’s KEV lists, vendor advisories, and threat intelligence reports, but it is inconsistently expressed, often duplicated, and rarely machine-parseable in a coherent way. The GCVE KEV format (BCP-07) provides a structured and open way to express these assertions while anchoring them to a shared vulnerability identifier when one exists.

Importantly, KEV entries are assertions, not ground truth.

They may later be revised, withdrawn, or contradicted by other observers. Decoupling identity from assertions allows such evolution without disconnecting from the underlying vulnerability record. A vulnerability identity should remain stable even if claims about exploitation change over time.

This model also assumes that multiple assertions per vulnerability identity are normal and expected. Different organisations may publish different KEV entries, CVSS scores, or detection signatures for the same GCVE ID, reflecting different perspectives, evidence sets, or confidence levels. Centralising identity while allowing plural assertions enables this diversity in a federated model.

With respect to identity-related data (such as vendor, product, or RCE status), once a vulnerability identity is established and assigned a GCVE ID, CVE ID (or any id), that identity should be the container for stable characteristics from a vendor. Assertions such as KEV entries, CVSS vectors, or signatures should primarily reference the GCVE ID, CVE ID (or any id) and focus on what is specific to the assertion itself: context, timing, confidence, evidence, or scoring rationale. The goal is not to repeat identity-defining attributes in every assertion.

Finally, this separation is essential for machine-readability. Clear boundaries between identity and assertions enable automated correlation, reasoning, and downstream decision-making across heterogeneous data sources. GCVE KEV (BCP-07) treats exploitation knowledge as structured data, without overloading the vulnerability identity layer itself.

## Format

It's a single JSON object (ECMA 404) per KEV entry. The KEV entry is associated to a vulnerability ID in GCVE ID or any known vulnerability identifier.

## GCVE KEV Directory and Source Index Format

BCP-07 describes individual KEV assertions, but implementers also need a way to discover which organisations publish KEV catalogues and where their machine-readable feeds are located. The GCVE initiative therefore maintains the [GCVE KEV directory](https://github.com/gcve-eu/gcve.eu-directory/blob/main/references.json), a non-mandatory index in which KEV producers can announce their catalogues and exploitation assertions.

A KEV producer can be a vendor, a CSIRT, or any other organisation observing or reporting exploitation. Producers register a stable source entry in the directory and provide one of the following machine-readable endpoints:

- A `bcp_07_url` that directly publishes assertions in the BCP-07 format defined by this document.
- An `automation_url` that publishes a native KEV format. Where direct BCP-07 output is not available, a converter can transform that feed; the [gcve-eu-kev project](https://github.com/gcve-eu/gcve-eu-kev) provides scripts and examples for such conversions.

Consumers and catalogue operators can use the directory to discover these distributed sources, retrieve or convert their assertions, and combine them into a more complete overview without treating any single producer as the universal source of truth. One implementation of this aggregation workflow is the [GCVE KEV catalogues overview](https://db.gcve.eu/kev-catalogs), provided by Vulnerability-Lookup.

The index is a catalogue of KEV catalogues. It is not authoritative for the content of any listed catalogue and it is not required for a producer to publish BCP-07 KEV assertions. Its purpose is to facilitate discovery, correlation, and stable attribution of KEV catalogues, especially where `gcve.origin_uuid` or `evidence[].gcve.origin_uuid` values need to be resolved to a known source.

### Index Object

The index is a single JSON object (ECMA 404) with a `kev` array. Each item in the array describes one KEV catalogue or source.
